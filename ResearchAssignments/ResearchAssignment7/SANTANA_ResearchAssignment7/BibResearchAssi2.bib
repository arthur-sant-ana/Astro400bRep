               contributions of several satellites, falling onto their host
               with their different masses, at different times, on different
               orbits. This work uses a suite of idealised, collisionless
               N-body simulations of minor mergers and a particle tagging
               technique to understand how these different ingredients shape
               each contribution to the accreted halo, in both density and
               kinematics. I find that more massive satellites deposit their
               stars deeper into the gravitational potential of the host, with
               a clear segregation enforced by dynamical friction. Earlier
               accretion events contribute more to the inner regions of the
               halo; more concentrated subhaloes sink deeper through increased
               dynamical friction. The orbital circularity of the progenitor at
               infall is only important for low-mass satellites: dynamical
               friction efficiently radialises the most massive minor mergers
               erasing the imprint of the infall orbit for satellite-to-host
               virial mass ratios $\gtrsim1/20$. The kinematics of the stars
               contributed by each satellite is also ordered with satellite
               mass: low-mass satellites contribute fast-moving populations, in
               both ordered rotation and radial velocity dispersion. In turn,
               contributions by massive satellites have lower velocity
               dispersion and lose their angular momentum to dynamical
               friction, resulting in a strong radial anisotropy.",

  title     = "The dynamics of tidal tails from massive satellites",
  author    = "Choi, Jun-Hwan and Weinberg, Martin D and Katz, Neal",
  abstract  = "We investigate the dynamical mechanisms responsible for
               producing tidal tails from dwarf satellites using N-body
               simulations. We describe the essential dynamical mechanisms and
               morphological consequences of tail production in satellites with
               masses greater than 0.0001 of the host halo virial mass. We
               identify two important dynamical co-conspirators: 1) the points
               where the attractive force of the host halo and satellite are
               balanced (X-points) do not occur at equal distances from the
               satellite centre or at the same equipotential value for massive
               satellites, breaking the morphological symmetry of the leading
               and trailing tails; and 2) the escaped ejecta in the leading
               (trailing) tail continues to be decelerated (accelerated) by the
               satellite's gravity leading to large offsets of the ejecta
               orbits from the satellite orbit. The effect of the satellite's
               self gravity decreases only weakly with a decreasing ratio of
               satellite mass to host halo mass, proportional to (Ms/Mh) 1/3 ,
               demonstrating the importance of these effects over a wide range
               of subhalo masses. Not only will the morphology of the leading
               and trailing tails for massive satellites be different, but the
               observed radial velocities of the tails will be displaced from
               that of the satellite orbit; both the displacement and the
               maximum radial velocity is proportional to satellite mass. If
               the tails are assumed to follow the progenitor satellite orbits,
               the tails from satellites with masses greater than 0.0001 of the
               host halo virial mass in a spherical halo will appear to
               indicate a flattened halo. Therefore, a constraint on the Milky
               Way halo shape using tidal streams requires mass-dependent
               modelling. Similarly, we compute the the distribution of tail
               orbits both in Er r 2 space (Lynden-Bell \& Lynden-Bell 1995)
               and in E Lz space (Helmi \& de Zeeuw 2000), advocated for
               identifying satellite stream relics. The acceleration of ejecta
               by a massive satellite during escape spreads the velocity
               distribution and obscures the signature of a well-defined
               ``moving group'' in phase space. Although these findings
               complicate the interpretation of stellar streams and moving
               groups, the intrinsic mass dependence provides additional
               leverage on both halo and progenitor satellite properties.",

               around 13 Milky Way analogs in the FIRE-2 simulations to streams
               observed by the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey (S
               5). For an accurate comparison, we produce mock Dark Energy
               Survey (DES) observations of the FIRE streams and estimate the
               detectability of their tidal tails and progenitors. The number
               and stellar mass distributions of detectable stellar streams is
               consistent between observations and simulations. However, there
               are discrepancies in the distributions of pericenters and
               apocenters, with the detectable FIRE streams, on average,
               forming at larger pericenters (out to >110 kpc) and surviving
               only at larger apocenters (â‰³40 kpc) than those observed in the
               Milky Way. We find that the population of high-stellar-mass
               dwarf galaxy streams in the Milky Way is incomplete.
               Interestingly, a large fraction of the FIRE streams would only
               be detected as intact satellites in DES-like observations, since
               their tidal tails have too low surface brightness to be
               detectable. We thus predict a population of yet-undetected tidal
               tails around Milky Way satellites, as well as a population of
               fully undetected low-surface-brightness stellar streams, and
               estimate their detectability with the Rubin Observatory.
               Finally, we discuss the causes and implications of the
               discrepancies between the stream populations in FIRE and the
               Milky Way, and explore future avenues for tests of satellite
               disruption in cosmological simulations.",

                  globular cluster. NGC 5466 reportedly possesses a long
                  stellar stream, although no individual members of the stream

               which there is much debate. We use numerical simulations to
               explore the evolution of debris from a tidally disrupted
               satellite, with the aim of developing a method that can be used
               to identify and quantify signatures of accretion in a survey of

               test by applying it to artificially constructed halo
               distributions. Our results suggest that if as few as 1\% of the

               single subsystem smaller than the Large Magellanic Cloud, GC3
